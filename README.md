# SyncPoints

A program for simulating random walks on directed graphs of a fixed number of points. The points are synchronized at vertices, meaning that when a set number of points come to a vertice, out of every outgoing edge a new point will emerge.

SyncPoints can generate new graphs and starting point layouts for you, or you can import a graph from GraphML.

After you're done with the model, you can view all relevant data and export it to XML and JSON for further analysis.
